## BCG Insitu: Untangling the link between skin reactions to BCG vaccination and improved newborn health outcomes

Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG; a live vaccine containing attenuated Mycobacterium bovis), the vaccine against Tuberculosis (TB), is one of the oldest vaccines still given and one of the most administered in vaccine history. The benefits of BCG vaccination extend far beyond offering protection against TB and have been found to reduce risk for serious infections resulting in deaths or hospitalizations from unrelated infections; called non-specific or pathogen-agnostic effects of the BCG vaccine. These pathogen-agnostic effects are especially powerful when BCG is given to newborns, who are at exceptionally high risk to die of infectious diseases; BCG-vaccinated newborns in low resource settings have half the risk to die compared to unvaccinated newborns. These effects involve the way that the BCG vaccine alters innate immunity. BCG induces a process called "trained immunity", which epigenetically reprograms stem cells in the bone marrow to give rise to monocytes that are "trained" to mount a more robust inflammatory response to unrelated stimuli. In newborns, our team [discovered](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aax4517) that BCG also induces a process called "emergency granulopoiesis (EG)", or a rapid production of mature neutrophils, which are then able to rapidly clear invading microbes. EG explains the beneficial pathogen-agnostic effects of BCG vaccination in newborns. The cytokine Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) initiates EG.

However, we have not identified how BCG initiates the production of G-CSF: which molecular sensors are used, and which cells mount this initial response. Also, why BCG induces G-CSF and EG in newborns, but not in adults is also a mystery. Given that BCG is given into the skin as an intradermal injection, the answer likely lies in this tissue.

## Fuel for Survival: metabolic interventions to prevent neonatal sepsis

Of all children that die in the first 5 years of life, half are newborns. Sepsis, a host response to systemic microbial infection, is a leading cause. While vaccines have eliminated a substantial burden of severe infection among older children, most are not given to neonates, and the time required to mount an adaptive immune make them ineffective for neonatal infection prevention. With this, therapies that broadly enhance host resilience to infection, that could work quickly while being feasible to implement in low-resource settings are most likely to make a difference. Our research identified how boosting the newborn's innate immune system with the Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis offers protection from neonatal sepsis by stimulating the newborn host to rapidly produce mature neutrophils through a process called "emergency granulopoesis", or EG.

Our research was motivated by real-world findings from randomized clinical trials showing that BCG vaccination lowered the risk for newborns to die by half. However, not all newborns benefit from BCG vaccination, and we hypothesize that this is because immune boosters like BCG need "fuel" to work. Robust data from human studies had found that newborns that are not fed colostrum, the first breast milk, within an hour of birth are more likely to die from infectious disease. Given the strong relationship between nutrition and immune responses, we are now investigating how there critical first feeds impact on newborn immunity and the response to BCG.
