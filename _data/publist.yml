  description: BCG reduces risk for all-cause mortality among newborns by 50%! But the mechanisms were unknown. So we went to work sorting it out.  It's the neutrophils.

  description: Newborns might not look like they're doing much, there there are massive immune developments happening under the hood. Here we find that these developments are remarkably similar across diverse populations.

- title: "Biogeography of the Relationship between the Child Gut Microbiome and Innate Immune System"
  image: biogeography.png
  description: From roughly 2006, as the microbiome field took off, we gained awareness of its' profound impact on our immune health. In this paper we explored correlations between the microbiome and systemic immune function in children around the world.

  image: immaturitymyth.png
  description: Newborns have long been described as immunologically "immature". We disagree. In this review, we propose that newborn immunity is well-adapted to the metabolic demands of this life stage. Finding ways to improve newborn health means we need to keep this at the forefront.
